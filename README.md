# Python-HTML-Scraping

A work in progress.

This is a program meant to parse builk html and pdf data from Google Scholar and store it into a MySQL database. The data can then be analyzed using specific queries to the database in order to identify possible suspects of citation-cliqueing and in turn, academic fraud.
